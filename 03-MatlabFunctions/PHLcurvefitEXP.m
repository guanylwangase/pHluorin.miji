function [fitresult,gof]=PHLcurvefitEXP(ppp)
%CREATEFIT Create plot of data sets and fits
%   CREATEFIT(PPP)
%   Creates a plot, similar to the plot in the main Curve Fitting Tool,
%   using the data that you provide as input.  You can
%   use this function with the same data you used with CFTOOL
%   or with different data.  You may want to edit the function to
%   customize the code and this help message.
